## Getting Started

To build and run these tools, follow these general steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:** Use Git to download the code:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/taha-idra/CLI-Toolkit.git](https://github.com/taha-idra/CLI-Toolkit.git)
    ```

2.  **Go to the tool's directory:** Navigate to the folder of the specific tool you want to use:

    ```bash
    cd CLI-Toolkit/<tool-name>
    ```

    For example, to use the Task Manager, you would type:

    ```bash
    cd CLI-Toolkit/TaskManager
    ```

3.  **Build the project:** Use `make` (or `cmake` if required by the tool):

    ```bash
    make
    ```

4.  **Run the tool:** Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./<executable-name>
    ```

    The executable name is usually the same as the tool's name (e.g., `./TaskManager`).

## Example (Task Manager)

Here's a quick example of how to use the Task Manager:

1.  Go to the Task Manager directory: `cd CLI-Toolkit/TaskManager`
2.  Build it: `make`
3.  Run it: `./TaskManager`

The Task Manager will then start, and you can use its commands to manage your tasks.
